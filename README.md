# About PoPMuSiC
PoPMuSiC is a free-to-use web service, but the user needs to [create an account](https://soft.dezyme.com/register/) first. Normal accounts can only submit public entries from the PDB, but you can submit your own files for non-commercial purposes after submitting the [private account agreement](https://soft.dezyme.com/bundles/myappmusic/file/Private_account.pdf).

To learn how to use the PoPMuSiC web service itself, a (little outdated) [user guide](https://soft.dezyme.com/bundles/myappmusic/file/Dezyme_User_Guide.pdf) is available.
